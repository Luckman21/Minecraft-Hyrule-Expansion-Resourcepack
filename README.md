# Minecraft-Hyrule-Expansion-Resourcepack
A resourcepack I've developed to enjoy my version of Hyrule!

Currently, this pack supports Minecraft Java Edition, versions 1.20.2 to 1.21.1.

This pack currently contains the following changes:
- Puppet Princess Zelda texture + sounds (Witch)
- Phantom Ganondorf texture + sounds (Evoker)
- Bubble texture (Vex)
- Guardian texture (Ghast) *W.I.P*
- Song of Time (Goat Horn call1.ogg overwrite)

More to be added in the future!
